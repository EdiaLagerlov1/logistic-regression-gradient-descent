You are a software architect, Please plan prd.md to the task below 
Please follow: 
- **Maximum file length**: 150 lines per file (strict limit) - **Single Responsibility**: Each file/class/function does ONE thing - **No duplicate code**: Extract common logic into reusable functions - **Separation of Concerns**: Separate data, business logic, and presentation

The task:

1.Create 2 groups of 100 points ( x1, x2 )  x1, x2 are between 0-1  so that each group has a Gaussian distribution with constant mean and variance (random), and so that the points do not overlap across the group

2. Classify them into blue and red groups

3. Create a data set ( x0=1, x1, x2, response) from the data

4.  Find sigmoid1 using the data set and vector 𝛽1 (parameter)

5. Calc the response for each ( x0=1, x1, x2) using sigmoid1
6. Display a graph of the points with the two group's distributions : the original, in red and blue, and according to sigmoid1, in light red and light blue respectively

7. Run gradient descent to achieve max likelihood using log likelihood and run number (parameter) of iterations and number(parameter) of learning steps , for each iteration keep 5𝛽, 4𝛽 , 3𝛽, 2𝛽 ect. Respectively

8. 
For each 𝛽 find the average error by running the sigmoid on the data set, and finding the average Euclidean distance between the response and the sigmoid result
9. 
For each 𝛽 find the average error by running the sigmoid on the data set, and finding the average Euclidean distance between the response and the sigmoid result

10. Both graphs should display in same page
